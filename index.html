    <p style="font-family: calibri;text-align: justify;font-size: large;"> The North East's Khasi Hills 
        experience a beautiful season of cherry blossoms as soon as the spring season comes. 
        Shillong even hosts a festival, International Cherry Blossom Festival that is dedicated 
        entirely to the blooming flowers. One of the places with cherry blossom trees is Sikkim. 
        These flowers only grow in two spots in the state. The first is that the Kanchenjunga National 
        Park region observes the season of the pink blooms, also known as Sakura in Japan, throughout 
        November and December.</p>

    <p style="font-family: calibri;text-align: justify;font-size: large;"> Bangalore bursts into bloom in March,
         engulfing often gloomy locations like Silk Board and Kundanahalli Gate with pink trumpet flowers that 
         resemble cherry blossoms. They are affectionately referred to as "Bengaluru's own cherry blossoms" and 
         are eagerly documented in social media posts. Japan might be the best-known destination for cherry 
         blossoms, but there are parks, gardens, and scenic drives where you can see these pale pink 
         flowers all over the United States</p>
